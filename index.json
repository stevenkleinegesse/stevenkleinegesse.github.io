For implicit models, where the likelihood is intractable but sampling from the model is possible, this task is particularly difficult and therefore largely unexplored. This is mainly due to technical difficulties associated with approximating posterior distributions and utility functions. We devise a novel experimental design framework for implicit models that improves upon previous work in two ways. First, we use the mutual information between parameters and data as the utility function, which has previously not been feasible. We achieve this by utilising Likelihood-Free Inference by Ratio Estimation (LFIRE) to approximate posterior distributions, instead of the traditional approximate Bayesian computation or synthetic likelihood methods. Secondly, we use Bayesian optimisation in order to solve the optimal design problem, as opposed to the typically used grid search or sampling-based methods. We find that this increases efficiency and allows us to consider higher design dimensions.","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Bayesian Experimental Design for Implicit Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Williams","Steven Kleinegesse","Ramona Comanescu","Oana Radu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530399600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530399600,"objectID":"d6b022705298b49e931c4c04ad3e1ae6","permalink":"https://stevenkleinegesse.github.io/publication/williams-2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/williams-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We present our system description of input-level multimodal fusion of audio, video, and text for recognition of emotions and their intensities for the 2018 First Grand Challenge on Computational Modeling of Human Multimodal Language. Our proposed approach is based on input-level feature fusion with sequence learning from Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our fusion approach outperforms unimodal predictors. Our system performs 6-way simultaneous classification and regression, allowing for overlapping emotion labels in a video segment. This leads to an overall binary accuracy of 90%, overall 4-class accuracy of 89.2% and an overall mean-absolute-error (MAE) of 0.12. Our work shows that an early fusion technique can effectively predict the presence of multi-label emotions as well as their coarse-grained intensities. The presented multimodal approach creates a simple and robust baseline on this new Grand Challenge dataset. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of emotion intensity distributions as output from our DNN, as well as a related discussion concerning the inherent difficulty of this task.","tags":null,"title":"Recognizing Emotions in Video Using Multimodal DNN Feature Fusion","type":"publication"}]
